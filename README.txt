 How To Play:
A keyboard is required for all gameplay

 Making a character
Once the games is started Player one and two will have three loadouts or special classes
that are unique in every way. The loadut is selected by pressing the corresponding number key. 

 Loadouts 
These are the three classes each player gets to choose from at the start with each doing special 
stats, attacks, personalized inventory, and unique features.

 Knight:
The Knight is a loadout for those that want to take many hits! The knight has two 
special abilites, Knight's Honor and Knights Fury. Knight's Honor increases defense, 
as Knight's Fury increases damage output.

 Archer:
The Archer is the choice for those that wish to keep damage going from a range!
The Archers special abilites are Hunters Focus, Hunter's Pierce, and Bandit Hunter.
The Archer's Hunter's focus determines how much extra your arrows deal.
Hunter's Pierce ignores the best defenses and adds more damage, as the bandit hunter
adds even more damage if fighting a evil class!

 Wizard:
The Wizard has magic and scrolls for his favorite attacks! The Wizard has only one special skill,
Wizard's Destruction. Wizard's Destruction makes his spells cast stronger than ever if your magic 
meter is able to cast it! 


 Attacking
Player one always starts the battle once both players have selected their special loadout.
The first option would be to attack, which is just they number 1 key. Each class have a unique attack 
pattern and abilties. Once attack key is pressed health will be lowered for the enemy!
Archers must select a arrow type tip type that varies in damage by selecting with the keys 1, 2, or 3! 
The Wizard must select a scroll before each attack that varies in damage with either the key 1, or 2!

 
 Switching Weapons
Weapon switching can make or break a close match, this option allows each player to switch their 
current weapon on the players turns. The key to open the switch menu is 2, this will bring 
up a menu with the items you have and the damage each one does! The weapons will have 1, 2, 3, and 4
next to the names, type the number of the weapon you wish to equip.

 Healing
Who says healing is always the bad choice? This option allows the user to heal for 10 health, and make sure
that their health does not exceed pass 100! The key players need to press is number key 3. Healing will take 
up a whole turn for a player as it is very difficult to fight and bandage up wounds at the same time!

 Flow of Game:
The flow of how the game works is very simple and yet interesting! The two players get an loadout selection
menu that is awaiting input to assign the players their chosen classes! Once Chosen the screen will clear and
the true battle will begin! The players stats will be printed for them to see each of their turns! Once one of
the players falls, the winner will be displayed and the victory is added to the data of wins for each player.

 How to Run:
Now lets go over on how to setup and run the game, first make sure to download the release and have the folder
wherever you please to put it. If you are using 7zip or winrar it is a wise idea to extract to a folder to have
for use! Next open the folder you will either see a folder, or the game files including the exe needed to start 
the game. If you see a folder no worries just open the folder and look closely for a exe program.
